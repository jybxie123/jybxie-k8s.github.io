# SUMMARY of work

I have worked for a year in Openpie, a cloud-native database company. As a full-stack engineer, I gained a lot and want to summrize some knowledge learned here.
Noted that this is a memoir, because my code is not open-source and I cannot share the code.
Here we go, don't worry, I will update this part slowly.
